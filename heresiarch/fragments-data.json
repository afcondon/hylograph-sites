    {"text": "My life is nothing like theirs was. Nobody has ever asked me to shoot anybody. I've got a big-screen TV. I could get sushi delivered to my house in 30 minutes. The Social Security Administration thinks I might make it to 80. Why would I risk all this? The things my grandparents did casually—smoking, hitching a ride in the back of a pickup truck, postponing medical treatment until absolutely necessary—all of those feel unthinkable to me now. I have a miniature heart attack just looking at the kinds of playgrounds they had back then."},

So a bank clerk dreams, as he enters his manager's drawing-room, of possessing one just like it. If he makes his way, twenty years later it will not be the luxury then in fashion that he will want to display in his house, but the out-of-date luxury that fascinated him long before."},

    {"text": "The ultimate and most sublime values have retreated from public life either into the transcendental realm of mystic life or into the brotherliness of direct and personal human relations. It is not accidental that our greatest art is intimate and not monumental, nor is it accidental that today only within the smallest and intimate circles, in personal human situations, in pianissimo, that something is pulsating that corresponds to the prophetic pneuma, which in former times swept through the great communities like a firebrand, welding them together."},
    {"text": "Farewell, Hans—whether you live or stay where you are! Your chances are not good. The wicked dance in which you are caught up will last many a little sinful year yet, and we would not wager much that you will come out whole. To be honest, we are not really bothered about leaving the question open. Adventures in the flesh and spirit, which enhanced and heightened your ordinariness, allowed you to survive in the spirit what you probably will not survive in the flesh. There were moments when, as you \"played king,\" you saw the intimation of a dream of love rising up out of death and this carnal body. And out of this worldwide festival of death, this ugly rutting fever that inflames the rainy evening sky all round—will love someday rise up out of this, too?"},
    {"text": "I lived on the edge. Death, the blind strangler, had failed to find me, but a human being had died in Russia, and I didn't know who it was... We were required to subject our own lives to the will of the age, and our destiny began like a tale of duress, patience, and death. We could not escape the law, there was a breach in our unfinished sense of the world, and like a dream, the march into the other and the unknown began, and all our paths ended in night."},
    {"text": "Neither the male authors nor the male readers most preoccupied with middle age are inclined to face it cleanly. The male author depicts the mid-life crisis to escape his own. His novels and screenplays are an adolescent retort to the anxieties of ease. Thus the implausible sexscapades, couture bloodletting, and whiny retreats into solipsism that have defined so much of American literature over the last seven decades. In this tradition, there is little difference between a literary depiction of the middle class man and a demeaning one."},

The Enlightenment project of giving us a basis of moral conduct in reason has failed, leaving us with mere emotivism, basically the notion that moral judgements are the same as saying, \"I like this, it makes me feel good.\""},

Any who were not heart and soul determined to stick it out would fade out right away. Any whose nerves were too sensitive couldn't take it, and I really mean couldn't. There are times when those chippers get going and two shipfitters on opposite sides of a metal wall swing tremendous sledge-hammers simultaneously and you wonder if your ears can stand it. Sometimes the din will seem to swell and engulf you like a treacherous wave in surf-bathing and you feel as if you were going under. Once I thought to myself, \"If this keeps on, I wonder—\" It makes you want to scream wildly. And then it struck me funny to realize a scream couldn't even be heard! So I screamed, loud and lustily, and couldn't even hear myself."},

Yes, the parallel with Balaam. Yes, the point that the magi give homage while the priests and the scribes do not, while the reigning king of Judah tries to kill him.

    {"text": "In the winter of 1857 Helmholtz presented a lecture in Bonn, \"The Physiological Causes of Harmony in Music.\" In his lecture, which touched on the connections between music, physics, and the anatomy of the ear, he gave an unusual description of a concert: \"From the mouths of the male singers proceed waves of six to twelve feet in length; from the lips of the female singers dart shorter waves, from eighteen to thirty-six inches long. The rustling of silken skirts excites little curls in the air, each instrument in the orchestra emits its peculiar waves, and all these systems expand spherically from their respective centers, dart through one another, are reflected from the walls of the room and thus rush backwards and forwards, until they succumb to the greater force of newly generated tones.\" In Helmholtz's account, the world is awash in vibration and resonance; it is \"a variegated crowd of intersecting wave systems.\" Not only music, but the whole audible world is full of repeating waves, everywhere… the world is overwhelming and filtering is a basic precondition for acting within it."},

This often resulted in airports buying hundreds or even thousands of homes in adjacent areas and demolishing them. LAX, for instance, bought and demolished the entire town of Surfridge. By the 1980s, airports around the country were spending $100 million per year on noise abatement, most of which went towards acquiring land parcels."},

There is the positive check: people so poor and malnourished that children's immune systems are compromised so that they get carried off by the common cold, and women so poor and hungry that ovulation becomes hit-or-miss. And there is the preventative check: late marriage for women, social shunning of those who engage in extra-marital intercourse, and conscious fertility limitation by couples so that you can live relatively well without the population exploding."},

    {"text": "This sounds like simple fun, but the hapax legomenon isn't always a laughing matter. It becomes a problem when ancient or lost languages have hapax legomena in their writings, because that makes it very difficult to figure out what the word in question means.

    {"text": "Von Neumann loved driving very much but had never passed a test. At Mariette's suggestion, he bribed a driving examiner. This did nothing to improve his driving. He sped along crowded roads as if they were many-body problems to be negotiated by calculating the best route through on the fly. He often failed, and an intersection in Princeton was soon christened \"Von Neumann Corner\" on account of the many accidents he had there. Bored on open roads, he slowed down. When conversation faltered, he would sing; swaying and rocking the steering wheel from side to side with him. The couple would buy a new car every year, usually because von Neumann had totalled the previous one. His vehicle of choice was a Cadillac, 'because', he explained 'no one would sell me a tank'. Miraculously, he escaped largely unscathed from these smash-ups, often returning with the unlikeliest of explanations. \"I was proceeding down the road,\" begins one fabulous excuse. \"The trees on the right were passing me in orderly fashion at 60 miles an hour. Suddenly one of them stepped in my path. Boom!\""},

At last the university authorities became nervous. Somebody wrote down Banach's remarks on some problems, and this was accepted as an excellent Ph.D. dissertation. But an exam was also required. One day Banach was accosted in the corridor and asked to go to a Dean's room, as \"some people have come and they want to know some mathematical details, and you will certainly be able to answer their questions\". Banach willingly answered the questions, not realising that he was just being examined by a special commission that had come to Lvov for this purpose."},

Nobody expected the stars to be that far away, so advantage Ptolemy. Meanwhile, the Copernicans posit far-off stars in order to save their paradigm.

In the beginning of all cultures a strong religious faith conceals and softens the nature of things, and gives men courage to bear pain and hardship patiently. If victory comes, if war is forgotten in security and peace, then wealth grows; the life of the body gives way, in the dominant classes, to the life of the senses and the mind; toil and suffering are replaced by pleasure and ease; science weakens faith even while thought and comfort weaken virility and fortitude.
